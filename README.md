# gnekoz-framework
A homemade php MVC framework


This is a small MVC php framework that I made a while ago when after few years of coding in almost pure php I stumbled upon [Zend Framework](https://framework.zend.com/) so I tried to create something (remotely!) inspired by it. 
Obviously this is WAY different from Zend Framework and it's far from optimal, but it was fun to create and I used it in a few projects before abandoning it and switching to a more reliable framework
